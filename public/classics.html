        <h2>Why Classics?</h2>
<p>Latin conquered me early, as I competed and succeeded in a quiz-bowl competition called Certamen and developed a rapport with the charismatic Christine Conklin, a Latin teacher with a thriving program in a Science and Tech school (Thomas Jefferson HS for SciTech). In ancient Greek and Latin, I have since found and appreciated a depth of meaning and structure more rewarding than the finest English-hidden works masterfully crafted in the exciting civilizations of the cultural conquerors who preceeded our own.</p>
<p>Those who can appreciate the word pictures of placement and form, the power and politics of the Roman government, the beauty and craft of literature both historic and mythological--to them is afforded a special appreciation of modern literature, language, history, and religion. Latin and Greek conjugations and declensions not only had their own rhyme and reason but cast a shadow on their descendant languages. Mastery of the language and culture is more empowering than any other discipline I have encountered, not only in the breadth of applications and diversity of influence, but also in the depth of insight it affords its followers.</p>

      <h2>The Beauty of Languages</h2>
      <p>Anyone who has studied a Romance language (Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, Romanian) probably had more than a few "EUREKA!" moments, where they derived or understood a word form based on some other anchor. Some of the easiest examples include cognates:</p>
    
    <table>
      <tr>
    <td><i><b>Latin</b></i></td>
    <td><b>English</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><i>porcus-pig</i></td>
    <td>pork</td>
    </tr>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><i>fama-rumor,"talk"</i></td>
    <td>fame</td>
    </tr>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><i>video-to see</i></td>
    <td>video</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><i>portus-harbor</i></td>
    <td>port</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
    <p>Even these relatively mundane cognates represent the excitement I find in Latin and Greek--making connections to previous knowledge, adding depth--dare I say it: <i>learning</i>, rather than memorization, is exciting! I argue that the mythological, cultural, grammatical, and literary elements of ancient Greek and Latin add depth to English. Take <i>fama</i> for example:</p>
<table><tr><td>
    <i><p>Extemplo Libyae magnas it Fama per urbes—<br>
Fama, malum qua non aliud velocius ullum;<br>
mobilitate viget, viresque adquirit eundo,<br>
parva metu primo, mox sese attollit in auras,<br>
ingrediturque solo, et caput inter nubila condit.<br>
...<br>
Nocte volat caeli medio terraeque per umbram,<br>
stridens, nec dulci declinat lumina somno;<br>
luce sedet custos aut summi culmine tecti,<br>
turribus aut altis, et magnas territat urbes;<br>
tam ficti pravique tenax, quam nuntia veri.<br>
~Aeneid IV:173-178,183-188
</p></i>
</td>
<td>
<p>Rumor goes immediately through the great cities of Libya-<br>
  Rumor, not any other evil is faster than she;<br>
  She thrives on speed, and from there acquires strength,<br>
  at first small from fear, soon she lifts her very self into the breezes,<br>
  and she steps across the earth, and plunges her head among the clouds.<br>
  ...<br>
  At night she flies in the middle of the sky and through the shadow of the earth,<br>
  shrieking, and in sweet sleep she does not lay down her gazes;<br>
  In light she sits as guard either on the peaks of the highest rooves,<br>
  or in the tall towers, and she terrifies the great cities;<br>
  Clinging to lies and depravities, so too she is the messenger of truth.<br>
  </p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<p>Imagine that every time you heard someone say the word "famous" you envisioned a monster with a thousand eyes, ears, and tongues spreading lies and the ugly truth through the day and night. Only a classists can truly enjoy the adjective "Bacchic" or "mercurial", conjuring up the unique personalities of the Greco-Roman anthropomorphic gods.</p>
<p>Greek words like ἁμαρτία (error) and Latin <i>gravitas</i> (dutiful seriousness) expose themselves only to those immersed in Greco-Roman culture, and yet succinctly capture qualities and characteristics still abundant today. Only one who has perused the tragedies of Sophocles can truly understand ὕβρις, only he who knows the Aeneid can understand <i>pietas</i>. The stories of Mucius Scaevola, burning off his right hand while staring down the enemy, of Cincinnatus, returning to his plow, Brutus and Collatinus starting a revolution, Pericles' funeral oration--these works are classics not because the Western world became enamored with marble statues and high religion, but because the language and its works capture and appeal to qualities intrinsic to humanity.</p>
<p>
  Perhaps such value comes from good literature and not the language itself--but the way in which roots can add depth to a word is equally valuable. When you list ingredients, you literally list the "steps" (<i>gredi</i>) which go "into" something--when you dictate, you "speak" not once but again and again. The form of word at a root can describe the sense of the verb--<i>sentio, to feel</i> lends itself to sentiment, consent, sentiment--all based on the present active. Yet the perfect (past tense) passive <i>sensus</i> gives rise to consensus, senses, sensory. Shared sentiments are different from consensus since they reflect their different root forms-sentiment is present, and fleeting, but a consensus has happened and is final. Words you didn't realize were English or Greek suddenly become 3D--a student is not simply one who studies, but someone who is <i>studeo-eager for</i> learning--a deluge in english carries with it a quantity, but from Latin <i>lavo-washing</i> and even Greek λούω-purge, cleanse, destroy.</p>
  <p> I could go on for an eternity working myself up on the myriad (literally 10,000) facets (literally "little forms/sides") of the Classics, but I hope you get a sense for what I mean. I haven't even begun to approach the incredible collection of awesome stories which are Roman history, or the hardy bad-assitude which makes up Roman culture. Needless to say, I am passionate about what the Greeks and Romans can teach us,and I treasure the humanity and insights which come with their study.

  <h2>Classics Papers</h2>
  <h3>A Review of the Statistical Methods and Implications in Wolfgang De Melo’s

<i>The Early Latin Verb System</i> <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bw1xWFQXOelCOWNrZVg4TzJVUjQ/edit"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span></a></h3>
  <p>Traditional linguistic arguments typically format evidence in several quotations from a
select corpus. As quantitative and computative linguistics expand, however, arguments 
containing thousands of examples from massive corpora present a striking contrast. What are the 
limits to statistical analysis of a language, let alone an ancient one? How do mathematical 
conclusions affect traditional approaches and theories? In analyzing Wolfgang De Melo’s use of 
the t-test in The Early Latin Verb System and subsequent deductions, this review will focus on 
changes in statistical methods and implications regarding Latin linguistics.</p>
  <h3>Crafting Comparison: Offices, Heroes, and Kings in Juvenal’s Satires 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bw1xWFQXOelCZzRFSHU0c01xZEk/edit"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span></a></h3><p>Satire today survives in outlets such as the Onion or Saturday Night Live, ridiculing and stereotyping modern phenomena for the entertainment of many. But every day or every 
week, the article or skit so cleverly created is replaced—its relevance questionable and message 
obsolete. Juvenal’s Satires, however, have endured for centuries, with their humor and criticisms 
remaining amazingly poignant. Despite “popular” references to figures of the time, and myriad 
differences between the modern era and Ancient Rome, the disparity between acceptable 
behavior and the current state of affairs gives his satire timeless power. How is this disparity 
created? Extremes are easily portrayed through embellishment and hyperbole on reality, but 
Juvenal’s image of decorous conduct requires incredible craft. This paper will discuss the 
elements which are used as a baseline of comparison against the travesties of Juvenal’s day: 
archetypes of the monarchy and republic and political offices. Furthermore, it will explore how 
and why such elements are such an effective tool for Juvenal, both for modern and ancient readers.</p>
  <h3>Depicting a Darker Dusk <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bw1xWFQXOelCLWpWVC1XdzhjUDg/edit"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span></a></h3><p>Massive slaughter and earth growing red with Tuscan blood make surprising subjects for
a love poet writing in elegiac meter—even more surprising when positioned before a merry-
filled holiday. Ovid’s version of the Battle of Cremara stands out in Book II of the Fasti as a 
grim tale, epic in nature and dark in tone. Why choose such an episode for the Ides? Analysis of 
the text with a political/historical perspective reveal a possible answer: Ovid utilizes the story of 
the 306 Fabii to depict the advancement of Rome under Augustus.</p>
<h3>quibusque artibus domi militiaeque <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bw1xWFQXOelCNXRJdUFZUElMdm8/edit"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span></a></h3>
<p>Livy invites his readers, modern and ancient, to see “by what skills of diplomacy and 
warfare the power of Rome was created and grew” while simultaneously tracking the moral 
decline of its people. Believing his contemporaries to be led astray by wealth and excess, Ab 
Urbe Condita is Livy’s “handbook to being a good Roman” in matters ranging from the 
domestic role of women to valor on the battlefield. Although some of his accounts may align 
with archaeological evidence, the selected speeches, battles, and diplomacy presented by Livy 
are most useful as insight into his intentions—why relate episodes as he did? Like Thucydides’ 
account of the Peloponnesian War, readers of antiquity would have expected much of the 
dialogue to be fabricated and some of the military exploits to be magnified. Fictional speeches 
allow the author to characterize and highlight issues of a time while exaggerated battles praise 
bravery and ingenuity at arms. However, incidents of foreign policy convey a more subtle 
message and address a different aspect of Livy’s declining world: diplomacy. In an attempt to 
embed and establish a custom of just foreign policy in Roman history, Livy punctuates the past 
with episodes of model diplomacy to demonstrate the swift, severe, and solemn nature of 
strategic statecraft.</p>
