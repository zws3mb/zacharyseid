        <h2>Why Computer Science? Why Machine Learning?</h2>
<p>Few disciplines allow creativity, expression, and innovation on a daily basis. The beauty of natural language is its recursive nature-the infinite combinations of infinite elements--and the unique ownership of a particular expression. Feedback is often immediate, be it a display, a calculation, or new functionality. Machine Learning combines my favorite disciplines--computer science for implementation, statistics for theory and generation of techniques--even classics and language can show up in natural language processing. For some, physics is the applied convergence of disciplines, but for me, I enjoy working on different levels--orchestrating distributed computing or cloud resources to execute a statistically based approach that analyzes some interesting domain-specific feature. I am simply glad there are jobs which correspond to my most engaging passions.</p>
