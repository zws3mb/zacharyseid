        <h2>Why Computer Science? Why Machine Learning?</h2>
<p>Few disciplines allow creativity, expression, and innovation on a daily basis. The beauty of natural language is its recursive nature-the infinite combinations of infinite elements--and the unique ownership of a particular expression. Feedback is often immediate, be it a display, a calculation, or new functionality. Machine Learning combines my favorite disciplines--computer science for implementation, statistics for theory and generation of techniques--even classics and language can show up in natural language processing. For some, physics is the applied convergence of disciplines, but for me, I enjoy working on different levels--orchestrating distributed computing or cloud resources to execute a statistically based approach that analyzes some interesting domain-specific feature. I am simply glad there are jobs which correspond to my most engaging passions.</p>

      <h3>Retribution<a href="https://github.com/zws3mb/retribution"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span></a></h3>
  <p>Created in a 6 person team for CSGame Design Course, taught by Professor Sherriff, this game written ontop the Monogame engine for Microsoft XNA studios features original graphics, original architecture design, and extensive coding in C#. I developed the entire system architecture, though parts of it were modified, as well as implementing the AI, 8/9 of the units, and all accessory aspects of the HUD (health, resources, buttons, help, instructions).</p>
    <h3>PhaseBook<a href="https://github.com/eea4ue/phase6"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span></a></h3>

Created in a team of 4 in Principles of Object-oriented Design, with emphasis on data structures and extensible architecture. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bw1xWFQXOelCdDNrRHl0ME9hdFU/edit?usp=sharing">Check out the report!</a></p>
<h3>Word-order Data Analysis</h3>
<p>Word-order Data Analysis-Semi-supervised NLP standalone app(Java) on ~5000 lines of Latin poetry utilizing 
user input and web-scraped dictionary info to categorize part of speech—analysis done in R post-manipulation</p>
<h3>Standalone Java Chat Client</h3>
<p>Multi-tabbed chat client pulling from GoogleContacts with a real-time friend list built in a team of 3 for CS2110 the intermediate programming class.</p>
<h3>Peer<a href="https://github.com/zws3mb/mcpeer"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span></a></h3>
<p> (Work in progress) Social web service (NodeJS, AngularJS,MySQL) which allows peers to anonymously endorse and follow professional achievements and comment on recent additions(like Current Projects). LinkedIn meets Reddit. Utilizing passport for security, I'm working with my housemate, coworker, and friend <a href="http://maxwellcraft.com">Maxwell Craft</a> to get this finished.</p>
<h3>jMetrik Psychometric Software</h3><p>Developed multivariate linear regression(Java) extending on Apache Math Commons library work under Professor J. P. Meyer of the Curry School’s distributed jMetrik software library</p>
<h3>zacharyseid.com</h3>
<p>Hosted on Heroku, this site is built on a vanilla flavor of NodeJS. Almost everything referenced on the website is done through Google Docs or Github, and while certainly no frontend work of art, I wanted some nitty-gritty experience with html, css, and templating through AJAX.</p>
