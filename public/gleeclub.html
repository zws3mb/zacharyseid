  Founded in 1871, the Virginia Glee Club is UVA’s oldest musical organization and amongst the oldest collegiate choirs in the United States.  With an extensive history of international touring, the Glee Club has performed in cities throughout England, Italy, Germany, Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Sweden, Belgium, and Spain.  Additional tours include two visits to the Soviet Union, with performances in Moscow and Leningrad.  In 1993, the group had the honor of performing for UVA alumna Katie Couric on the Today Show and for President Bill Clinton at the White House.  The group is conducted by Frank Albinder, who also directs the Washington Men’s Camerata and Woodley Ensemble, and has won Grammy recognition for his work with the internationally acclaimed male chorus, Chanticleer.  The Club celebrates its 11th season under Frank’s direction this year, and its third annual domestic tour. Having traversed the West Coast from Seattle to Las Vegas and the North East from Boston to Chicago, this year a packed bus will deliver harmony, love, and brotherhood to New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennesee. Having collaborated with Smith College on Orff’s Carmina Burana last spring, this year’s major work is Ralph Vaughn Williams’ Dona Nobis Pacem in collaboration with Wellesley.
 </p>
<p>The Glee Club is a fully student-run organization at the University of
Virginia, a university distinctive among institutions of higher education.
Founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, the University sustains the ideal of
developing leaders through education who are well prepared to help shape the
future of the nation. While there are no music performance majors at UVa,
and the singers receive no academic credit for their participation in this
extra-curricular organization, members consider The Virginia Glee Club to be
a fraternity of talent, committed to performing at the highest level,
promoting fellowship, preserving longstanding tradition, and upholding the
ideals of student self-governance.  In its 143rd season, the Club is honored
to sustain its legacy as the oldest musical organization at the University
of Virginia, and its members proudly remain "Virginia's Messengers of
Harmony, Love and Brotherhood"
