<p>The Virginia Fencing Club is competitive fencing organization, competing in intercollegiate tournaments with both club and varsity schools up and down the East Coast and throughout the country. We are a student run club sport team that competes in many tournaments throughout the school year, including the United States Association of Collegiate Fencing Clubs (USACFC) and Mid-Atlantic Collegiate Fencing Association (MACFA) conferences. Though we currently do not have a coach, we practice on a regular basis so that we may improve individually and together as a team. The club provides all necessary equipment and welcomes new members both with and without prior fencing experience. We practice Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of each week, and welcome new members at any time during the year.</p>
<p>
Every year, we compete in the following tournaments: Temple Open, three MACFA meets, MACFA Championships, SAC Championships, USACFC Championships, NIWFA Championships, NIWFA Christmas Invitational, Swarthmore Invitational, the Virginia Cup, and VIWFA Championships.</p>
